## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline

```python
# Load and preprocess data
from src.data import DataLoader
from src.features import FraudFeatureEngineer

# Initialize components
loader = DataLoader("data/raw")
engineer = FraudFeatureEngineer()

# Load datasets
fraud_df = loader.load_fraud_data()
ip_df = loader.load_ip_country_data()

# Feature engineering
features_df = engineer.create_time_features(fraud_df)
features_df = engineer.add_geolocation_features(features_df, ip_df)

# Handle class imbalance
X_balanced, y_balanced = engineer.apply_smote(features_df)
```

predictions = model.predict(X_test)

### Model Training & Explainability (Tasks 2 & 3 Accomplished)

```python
# Model training pipeline
from src.models import FraudDetectionModel

model = FraudDetectionModel()
model.train(X_balanced, y_balanced)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Model explainability example (using SHAP)
import shap
import joblib
model = joblib.load('models/best_model.joblib')
explainer = shap.Explainer(model, X_test.sample(100, random_state=42))
shap_values = explainer(X_test)
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test)
