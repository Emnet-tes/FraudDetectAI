# 🛡️ Fraud Detection System - Adey Innovations Inc.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive fraud detection system developed for Adey Innovations Inc., focusing on e-commerce and credit card transaction fraud detection. The project implements advanced machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives that could impact customer experience.

### 🚀 Project Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: Develop a robust fraud detection system with >85% precision and >80% recall
- **Business Impact**: Reduce fraud losses while maintaining excellent customer experience
- **Technical Excellence**: Implement scalable, production-ready ML pipeline
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provide actionable intelligence for fraud prevention strategies

## 📊 Datasets

### 1. E-commerce Transaction Data (`Fraud_Data.csv`)

- **Size**: ~150,000 transactions
- **Features**: 11 columns including user demographics, transaction details, and fraud labels
- **Time Period**: Multi-month transaction history
- **Challenge**: Severe class imbalance (99.83% legitimate, 0.17% fraud)

### 2. IP Geolocation Data (`IpAddress_to_Country.csv`)

- **Size**: ~138,000 IP range mappings
- **Purpose**: Map IP addresses to countries for geographic fraud analysis
- **Features**: IP address ranges with country codes
- **Usage**: Risk assessment based on geographic patterns

### 3. Credit Card Data (`creditcard.csv`)

- **Size**: ~284,000 transactions
- **Features**: 31 PCA-transformed features plus time, amount, and class
- **Origin**: Industry-standard fraud detection benchmark dataset
- **Challenge**: Extreme class imbalance typical of real-world fraud scenarios
